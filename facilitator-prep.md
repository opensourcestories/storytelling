# How to prep to facilitate a storytelling session

Welcome to the very important role of facilitating storytelling sessions.

## 1. Confirm your schedule with a storyteller.

* Keep your availability in the team schedule organizer up to date. This is the calendar which storytellers will use to schedule sessions with you.

* Check any other obligation calendars against the scheduled spot your storyteller has signed up for.

* Life happens and schedules change. Communicate as early as possible with your storyteller and our project leads if you need to reschedule or cancel a session.

## 2. Do your facilitation homework.

* Create a copy of [Storyteller Session Prep](https://github.com/opensourcestories/storytelling/session-prep-template.md).

  * Coordinate with storyteller to fill out personal information in the prep material.

  * Choose your Flow from [Conversation Flow for Open Source Storytellers](bit.ly/opensource-storytelling-conversation-flow)

  * Additional sample questions are available in our shared [story-questions bank](https://github.com/opensourcestories/story-questions).

* We respect the time we spend with each other. Read the prep doc.

## 3. Check your recording and admin setup.

* Are you signed into the communication channel you've been using to coordinate with the storyteller?

* Have you checked your audio recording channels?

* Do you have access to all of the docs and information you need to facilitate a storyteller? 

## 4. Arrive early.

* Be on the right platform at the right time.
