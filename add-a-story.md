# How to add a story

Once you have a transcript for the story, follow these steps to add it to [opensourcestories.org](https://opensourcestories.org). These instructions assume that you have followed the [setup instructions](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org#setup).

## Fork and branch

Fork [opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org) into your own GitHub account. If you already have a fork, you may want to make sure it is up-to-date.

We recommend creating a new branch for the new story, but this is optional.

## Create a new content page

To generate a markdown file with the correct front matter, use the `hugo` command from the root directory:

```shell
$ hugo new stories/{year}/{person name}.md
```

This will generate a mostly empty markdown file:

```markdown
title: ""
date:
description: ""
storyteller: ""
storycorps: ''
bio: ""
draft: true
---
```

## Filling out the page

*title*: page title
*date*: autogenerated, but update it with the date that the story was created
*description*: used for the index page and any social copy
*storyteller*: the person telling the story
*storycorps*: the URL `https://archive.storycorps.org/embed/{story id}`
*bio*: the 2-3 sentence bio that the storyteller provided
*draft*: true or false, depending if the page is ready for publishing

Under the `---`, paste the markdown of the transcript.

## Test it out

Run the local server using the command:

```shell
$ hugo server -D
```

and navigate to `localhost:1313` (or whichever port Hugo tells you).

## Submit it to the repo

Once you're happy with it, make sure to set the `draft` to false, and push the changes to your fork. From there, submit a pull request to the main repository!
