# How to add a story

Once you have a transcript *and* have uploaded a draft to [StoryCorps Connect](https://storycorps.org/participate/storycorps-connect/), follow these steps to add it to [opensourcestories.org](https://opensourcestories.org). These instructions assume that you have followed the [setup instructions](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org#setup).

## 1. Fork and branch

- Fork [opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org](https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org) into your own GitHub account.

  - Reminder: When you clone this repository, _be sure to get the submodules_! 

  ```shell
    git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/opensourcestories/opensourcestories.org.git 
  ```

- If you already have a fork, you may want to make sure it is up-to-date.

    - There are 3 easy ways to [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)  

- We recommend creating a new branch for the new story, but this is optional.

    - Details on how to [create a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch)

## 2. Create a new content page

To generate a markdown file with the correct [front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), use the `hugo` command from the root directory:

```shell
$ hugo new stories/{year}/{person name}.md
```

This will generate a mostly empty markdown file:

```markdown
title: ""
date:
description: ""
storyteller: ""
storycorps: ''
bio: ""
draft: true
---
```

## 3. Filling out the page

*title*: page title

*date*: autogenerated, but update it with the date that the story was created

*description*: used for the index page and any social copy

*storyteller*: the person telling the story

*storycorps*: the URL `https://archive.storycorps.org/embed/{story id}`, where the {story id} is the numeric portion of your uploaded StoryCorps interview ID

- For example, click through one of the current [Open Source Stories interviews](https://archive.storycorps.org/communities/open-source-stories/) to see the ID field on the interview page, e.g. [ID: APP3543191](https://archive.storycorps.org/interviews/julia-ferraioli-5/)

*bio*: the 2-3 sentence bio that the storyteller provided

*draft*: true or false, depending on whether the page is ready for publishing

Under the `---`, paste the markdown of the transcript.

## 4. Test it out

Run the local server using the command:

```shell
$ hugo server -D
```

and navigate to `localhost:1313` (or whichever port [Hugo tells you](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#livereload)).

## 5. Submit it to the repo

Once you're happy with it, make sure to set the `draft` to false, and push the changes to your fork. From there, submit a pull request to the main repository!
